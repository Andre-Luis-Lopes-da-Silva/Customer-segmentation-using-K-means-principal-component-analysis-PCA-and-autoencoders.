# Customer-segmentation-using-K-means-principal-component-analysis-PCA-and-autoencoders.
This case presents a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy using K-means, principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoders.

Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible. In other words, it is a process of transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space that still preserves the essence of the original data.

Two strategies were demonstrated:

First, the elbow method was used to determine the number of groups, then the K-means was performed and finally the PCA to plot the data.

Second, the autoencoder was used, followed by the curve method, then the K-means and finally the PCA.
